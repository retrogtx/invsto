# Invsto Frontend Assignment
This is a solution to the frontend assignment for Invsto. The assignment has been completed in Next.js, TailwindCSS, Shadcn/UI and Redux Toolkit. 

The exact replica has been made with the following features:
- Dark mode toggle
- Responsive design
- Interactive pricing component

Made a new svg for the background pattern to make it more dynamic under a dark mode environment.

### Page view and pricing totals
Here are the different page view ranges and the corresponding monthly price totals:

- 10K pageviews / $8 per month
- 50K pageviews / $12 per month
- 100K pageviews / $16 per month
- 500k pageviews / $24 per month
- 1M pageviews / $36 per month

If the visitor switches the toggle to yearly billing, a 25% discount will be applied to all prices.

The site is hosted for everyone to see on Vercel.
